**# Kickstarter-Analysis**
**##Overview**
This an excel spreadsheet analyzing different kickstarter programs.  Analyzing and comparing trends with what was successful and what failed.
The purpose of this project was to focus on two areas of the data.  First, theater outcomes based on when the project was launched.  Data was extracted to visualize if the time of year the fundraising is started makes a difference in the success of meeting the goal needed to fund the project.  The second area of focus was the plays subcategory and the amount of money needed to fund it. Were certain ranges of goals more successful?
**##Analysis**
To analyze theater outcomes based on when the project was launched, a pivot table was created.  See below.

The pivot table separated the theater information by month.  Then plotting the information in a line plot made it easy to visualize the months that had the most success.  Noted next to the pivot table in above screenshot.  Challenges presented with this data include the number of projects involved.
